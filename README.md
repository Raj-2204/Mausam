## Application Type and Description

Weather App
The Weather Application is an interactive web-based app designed to provide real-time weather information for users based on their current location or a specified city. The app allows users to view hourly forecasts, 7-day weather predictions, and detailed observations such as wind speed, cloud cover, and precipitation. Users can also save their favorite cities for quick access.

## Additional Details [As Needed]

This is the weather app I created, I haven't used the data.json that was given
because I was using nominatim api to fetch the current location of the user.

Steps:
1. Load the index.html on the chrome browser(recommended).
2. The use have to give access to your location for this to work as it will pick user's location
    and present weather according to that.
3. If user want to search a place or city, they can use the search bar provided (ENTER WILL NOT WORK) and use the search button.
4. There is favourite button place just next to search button, it will place the favourite cities in the 
    Favourite page of the website.
5. Favourite page isn't interactable.
